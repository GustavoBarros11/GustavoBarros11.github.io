					<!-- Content -->
					<h3 id="content">My name is Gustavo Barros</h3>
					<!-- <p>Undergraduate in Big Data & AI from Universidade Potiguar, I am currently 100% dedicated to my
						career transition from Full-Stack Web Developer to Data Scientist.</p> -->
					<p>My main goal is to build data-based products, developed with Machine Learning and/or Data
						Analytics
						skils to solve real-world business problems, generating profit and reducing costs.</p>
					<p>As a Data Scientist, my latest job was to create a Machine Learning solution to predict estimated
						value of sales for the next 6 weeks for a pharmacy chain in Europe. The trained Regression
						algorithm had 10% of MAPE (error metric) and was made available for queries through a Telegram
						bot.</p>
					<p>At Velty, I was personally responsible for building the company's institutional website. In
						addition to contributing, as a team, to building projects ranging from ecommerce to B2B systems,
						understanding the business model from companies and creating software based solutions for their
						demands. I was
						actively working with tools like Php, JavaScript, SQL, and Git, always using agile methodologies
						on a daily basis to menage the workflow.</p>
					<p>As a professional, I have always strived to learn enough skills to become an independent
						Data Scientist, capable of building end-to-end projects within the data science pipeline,
						ranging from data extraction to designing ML models and putting them into
						production.</p>
					<p>
						At this point in my career, I feel confident to work as a Data Scientist, so that I can create
						value by using my knowledge in Python, Statistics, Machine Learning, Storytelling as well as
						other tools, in order to build data solutions that can solve companies' problems.</p>
					<p><b>Analytical Tools</b>: SQL, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Pandas and Plotly.</br>
						<b>Development Tools</b>: Python, Php, JavaScript, Git, Scrum, Basic Docker and Linux.</br>
						<b>Pipeline Tools</b>: MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server and MongoDB.

						<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
					</header>
					<h3 id="content">Data Scientist Apprentice at Comunidade DS (08/2022 - current)</h3>
					<p>The Comunidade DS is an educational institution that provides an environment for developing data
						projects for business problems, close to the real challenges of companies. These projects are
						carried out individually by each professional, using public data and developing the problem from
						the conception of the business challenge to the implementation of the algorithm in production,
						through
						Cloud Computing tools.</p>
					<p> As a Data Scientist, I have been developing projects in the community <b>since August 2022</b>
						and the works produced are described in detail in the 'Projects' section. </p>
					<h3 id="content">2+ years of experience as a Full-Stack Web Developer</h3>
					<p>Professional experience in the position of Full-Stack Web Developer, where I could practice my
						knowledge in the following tools: git, gitlab, php, javascript, html, css, nodejs, sql, mongodb,
						laravel, and etc. I was also responsible many times for the entire pipeline of a project, from
						the creation of front-end, to database management and server logic. Also dealing with customer
						service, requirements gathering and presentations.</p>
					<h3 id="content">4+ real-world impacting Data Science Projects</h3>
					<p>Solving business problems that are close to real problems at various companies, using Data
						Science skills and publicly available data. These solutions possess all main steps a Data
						Science solution should have: understanding the business problem, collecting and cleaning data,
						feature engineering, going through exploratory data analysis, data preparation, feature
						selection, machine learning modeling, model evaluation, as well as translating model performance
						to financial and business results. Finally, deploying the final product by using a Cloud
						Computing tool.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 id="content">3+ industry-recognized certifications in Data Science</h3>
					<p>I have successfully graduated from the Deep Learning Nanodegree and the Machine Learning & AI
						Foundations Nanodegree from Udacity and also, more recently I became a certified Data Scientist
						by Datacamp. In all courses I was evaluated with practical projects that recreated real-world
						challenges involving data, applying the techniques and knowledge learnt throughout the courses.

							<h3>Creating a Bot that Predicts Rossmann Future Sales</h3>
							<p>In this project I used Python, Flask and Regression Algorithms to predict Rossmann sales,
								a drug store chain, six weeks in advance. Reason being Rossmann CEO needs to determine
								the best resource allocation for each store renovation. The final solution is a Telegram
								Bot that returns a sales prediction of any given available store number, with the
								possibility of being accessed from anywhere.</p>

							<h3>Credit Card Limit Classification</h3>
							<p>In this project, I solved a business case for Billion Bank, a fictional digital bank in
								Brazil that works with digital accounts and credit cards. When a customer requests an
								increase in their credit card limit, the bank consults a third-party credit company
								which returns a recommendation of "deny" or "approve". The process was slow and
								expensive, so they "hired" a data science team to create an internal credit evaluation
								model specific to the bank.</p>

							<h3>Used Car's Price predictor for Rent a Car Company</h3>
							<p>
								This project was developed by me and my group during Hackday #2, a hackathon organized
								for DS Community students. In order to solve this business problem, we had to develop a
								model to predict the price of a used car based on its characteristics, in order to help
								decision-making in the pricing of the car when the company is going to resell it after
								the end of its lifecycle.

							<h3>Classifying Dog Breed with a CNN</h3>
							<p>This project accepts any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image,
								it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide
								an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. In this real-world setting, I
								pieced together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the
								algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog
								breed.

							<h3>Predicting Bike Sharing Data</h3>
							<p>This is a Time-Series forecasting project, where I dealt with historical data from a
								real-world
								company called Cyclo Hop, whose business model consists of renting bicycles
								around the American major cities, and had the business problem of not finding the
								best total number of bicycles to keep in their stock throughout
								the year. For this project I created a neural network trained on historical data to make
								predictions about the optimal number of bicycles for the company to have over time.

							<h3>Market Research With ETL & Web Scraping</h3>
							<p>In this data engineering project I used Python, Web Scraping and PostgresSQL to create an
								ETL process for Star Jeans, a fictitious company. Star Jeans' owners in order to better
								understand the USA male's jeans market and learn how to enter it, they hired a Data
								Science/Engineering team to gather
								information regarding H&M. The built solution is an
								ETL that extracts data from H&M website, cleans it, and saves it to a PostgreSQL
								database on a weekly basis. Then, it adds and displays the data with filters in a
								Streamlit App, where it can be accessed from anywhere by Star Jeans' owners.</b>

							<h3>Business Solution for a Real Estate Company</h3>
							<p>In this insights project I used Python and Streamlit to solve a profit maximization
								problem for House Rocket, a fictitious real estate company, by suggesting whether a

								were applied the total obtained profit would be around US$ 473 million, with an average
