						In this project I completed all the pipeline steps of a Machine Learning project. The business
						problem consisted of assuming the role of a real estate agent who needs to have a good estimate
						of the price of houses in an area of ​​the city of Boston, for this I created a Neural Networks
						algorithm that uses the characteristics of each house to make a prediction of its price.
						Bringing automation into a real-state agent's work step, increasing its efficiency and reducing
						costs with possible miscalculations or bias.

					<h1 id="sec1">1. Business Problem</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent
						in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning
						concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily,
						you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features
						for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those
						areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools
						available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients'
						homes.

					<h1 id="sec2">2. Project Assumptions</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Some template code was provided.</li>
						<li>The dataset is a little outdated, so it don't represent real-world values for the
							estimations.</li>
						<li>Some pre-processing was made to the original dataset before it was made available for the
							project.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 id="sec3">3. Data Dictionary</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston
						housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about
						14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this
						project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or
							censored values and have been removed.</li>
						<li>1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has
							been removed.</li>
						<li>The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant
							features have been excluded.</li>
						<li>The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market
							inflation.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>BOSTON HOUSES DATASET</h3>
					<ul>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>VARIABLE</th>
								<th>DESCRIPTION</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>RM</td>
								<td>The average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.</td>

								<td>LSTAT</td>
								<td>The percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working
									poor).</td>

								<td>The ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the
									neighborhood.</td>

					<h1 id="sec5">5. Business Insights</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Slightly relevant, because the infrastructure of the neighborhoods changed, the
									inflation has changed too, other features that influenciates the final value of the
									property arose etc. Very important, because it changes the real value of goods and
									services over a period.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the
							entire neighborhood?:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Yes. It is one of the most important factors because it directly influences the
									quality of life of home owners.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors
							like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or
							not etc should factor in?
							<ul>
								<li>
									No, because it is missing features that could affect the selling price in today's
									housing market such as size of a backyard or if there is a garage, number of
									bathrooms, etc. Totally, yes.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h1 id="sec6">6. Conclusion</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Regarding the model:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too
									complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model
									could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data
									given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to
									allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is
									underfitted.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Regarding the Business Insights:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>This type of project is key to companies like a real-state agency, finding a way to
									predict the values of the homes based on their features increases speed, automate
									tasks, reduce costs with audit, etc. Such a solution, using ML and Data Science can
									bring a lot of value to those companies.</li>
