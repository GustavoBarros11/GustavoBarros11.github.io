					<p>
						This is a forecast type project, where I dealt with historical data from a real-world company
						called Cyclo Hop, whose business model consists of renting bicycles scattered around the city,
						and who had the business problem of not finding the best total number of bikes to keep in your
						inventory throughout the year. For this project I created a neural network trained on historical
						data to make predictions about the total number of bikes to have over time.

					<h1 id="sec1">1. Business Problem</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
						In this project, i built my first neural network utilizing concepts of Object-Oriented
						Programming (OOP), and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership. I have been provided with
						some template code, but they left the implementation of the neural network up to me. This
						project corresponded to the first project of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program, a
						compound of 5 total projects that a finished successfully.
					</p>
					<p>
						For this project you'll build a neural network to predict bike-sharing rides. Imagine yourself
						owning a bike sharing company like Cycle Hop. You want to predict how many bikes you need
						because if you have too few you're losing money from potential riders. If you have too many
						you're wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So you need to predict from
						historical data how many bikes you'll need in the near future. A good way to do this is with a
						neural network which is exactly what you'll do. In this notebook, you'll implement a neural
						network and train it on historical data to make predictions. The main goal is to successfully
						build an algorithm that can bring real-world value to this company, by improving one key
						features on its business model, utterly bringing more value to the company.

					<ul>
						<li>The dataset records daily historical data from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012.</li>

					<h1 id="sec5">5. Business Insights</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
						I found that Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal
						settings, such as holidays, climate, special events and Meteorological Seasons. Beyond the
						actual daily number of rides that can be used to efficiently manage the number of bikes
						available on the streets in a particular day, we can use the insights mentioned aboove to create
						special marketing strateies among with discounts, to increase the number of users in those
						particular days. All of this added can for shure increase the efficiency of the company's
						business model and retain more active daily users.
					</p>

					<h1 id="sec6">6. Conclusion</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Regarding the model:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>The model predict the data pretty well. It fails in some periods of time when the
									data shows some unsual pattern, such as long holidays and so on. Because they are
									isolated cases, it means that these patterns are only present in tiny pieces of the
									data, becoming harder to the model learn them.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Regarding the Business Insights:</b>
							<ul>
								<li>This type of project is key to the company business model, finding a way to not
									waste money with lack of demand and idle products is a huge problem that many
									companies face. Such a solution, using ML and Data Science can bring a lot of value
									to those companies.</li>
