					<p class="description">This is an insight project where a data base from house sales in the King
						County (USA) was used
						to generate insights to help the CEO of a American real-state agency on making decisions about
						buying and selling properties. The kc_house_data can be found on <a

					<p>Here, you can find the final dashboard APP: <a href="">House Rocket App</a></p>

					<h1 id="sec1">1. Business Problem</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>House Rocket is a platform for buying and selling properties. Its business model is buying
						properties and then selling them at a higher price, with the purpose of maximizing profit. The
						different attributes of the properties influence their quality and drawing power and, therefore,
						their price.</p>
					<p>The CEO would like to maximize the profit of the company, finding good deals. These are the main
						questions to be answered:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Which properties should House Rocket buy, and at what price?</li>
						<li>Once the property is aquired, what is the best moment to sell, and by which price?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Currently, the business team is not able to make good buying decisions without analysing the
						data. The portfolio is extremelly large, and very time consuming for manual analysis.</p>
					<h1 id="sec2">2. Project Assumptions</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Values of 0 in attribute yr_renovated are buildings that were not renovated.</li>
						<li>Recent renovations were considered to be the ones made after, and including, year 2000.</li>
						<li>The attribute price was considered to be the price the property was/will be bought by the
							House Rocket company.</li>
						<li>The duplicate ID values were removed and only considered the most recent buy.</li>
						<li>The location and condition of the property is key for the decision on wether to buy it or
							not.</li>
						<li>The season is the decisive variable for the selling of the properties.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 id="sec3">3. Data Dictionary</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes
						homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. There are 21 features for each house:</p>

					<h1 id="sec6">6. Conclusion</h1>
					<hr>
					<h5 id="financial-results-for-the-business">Financial Results for the Business</h5>
					<p>After the analysis, among the 21,435 properties available for purchase in the King County region,
						<strong>3808 were suggested for purchase</strong> and detailed in the Dashboard (report) for the
						&quot;CEO&quot;.</p>
					<p>If the recommended properties are purchased, the initial investment expected is $11.5 billion
						dollars. Upon resale of all properties, a total of $13.5 billion will be raised and the total
						expected profit is <strong>$1.97 billion</strong>, dollar, totaling a <strong>17% return on the
							capital initially invested</strong>.</p>

					<h1 id="sec8">7. Next Steps</h1>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Apply more robust techniques to handle with outliers</li>
						<li>Create a ML regression model to predict the price of the houses</li>
						<li>Create a ML model to estimate the optimal reselling price for given house</li>
						<li>Create new hyphotesis and validate them</li>
